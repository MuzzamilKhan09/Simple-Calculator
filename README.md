# Simple-Calculator
Hi!
This is a simple, basic claculator which is built using HTML5, CSS, And Javascript.
This is source code for a calculator using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I Know this is very basic, but always remember basic is most important. Whose basic has weak they can â€˜t become an expert. This is my Opinion.
